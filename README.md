# Arctos
.Net / WPF Application Framework/Hosting System

 Yes once again a WPF App Framework / Hosting system, the difference is I wrote this for myself and am only now sharing it because it provides core functionality to other project that i would like to to make open source.
 This project was origanally created to target .Net Framework and as such will have little work done on due to porting to .Net Core under the name of 'ArctosX'
